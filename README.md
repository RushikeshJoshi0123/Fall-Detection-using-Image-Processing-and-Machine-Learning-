# Fall-Detection-using-Image-Processing-and-Machine-Learning-

Falls are the major issues which occurs unexpectedly. This can also lead sometimes to death. Elderly persons are at the topmost risk and their life can also be in danger. There are lots of deaths caused due to the fall of elderly persons. This project aims to predict the fall as soon as it takes place.

Process

• Complete image pre-processing, which includes image background removal, edge detection, star feature extractor and brisk feature descriptor.

• Used multiple machine learning algorithm like Random Forest, Decision Tree and KNN.

• Determining the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms.

• Predicting the fall.
